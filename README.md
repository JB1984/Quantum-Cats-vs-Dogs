# QuantumCatClassifier
Quantum Computing classifier using Pennylane

This project is based on an implementation of the Data-reuploading Classifier listed here https://pennylane.ai/qml/app/tutorial_data_reuploading_classifier.html
<br><br>
It uses the above implementation and then expands on that to create a classifier for images. My implementation only requies one Qubit to run. It may be possible to expand this in the future to multiple Qubits using a hadamard gate to entangle another Qubit with the first one.
<br><br>
Also took inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex tutorial series on PyTorch. Used his implementation of data rangling and preprocessing to get the cat and dog images ready for a run through the algorithm.
